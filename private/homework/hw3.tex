\newcommand{\filename}{measurements.dat}
\section*{String Parsing}
\subsection*{Description}
A coworker has recorded some measurements which you need. They send the file to you and you find it is terribly formatted!
\\\\\texttt{(TIME, VALUE)\\
(0.00, 0.73)\\
(0.02, 5.97)\\
(0.04, 2.47)\\
etc...}

You decide to reformat the file for them to make it easier to read the data. Your job in this homework is to read in the data from \filename{} and write it to a new file \texttt{measurements\_new.dat} in the following format:
\\\\\texttt{TIME VALUE\\
	0.00 0.73\\
	0.02 5.97\\
	0.04 2.47\\
	etc...}

Notice that the commas and parentheses have been removed.

\subsection*{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Download the file \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R6SKvNjw3gBTm9NVox_0aP4c2HqBlKcj/view?usp=sharing}{\filename} from Google Drive
	\item Write two functions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \texttt{double get\_time(string line)}
		\item \texttt{double get\_value(string line)}
	\end{enumerate}
	\texttt{get\_time} accepts a line from the file as input, parses the string, and returns the first of the two numbers. \texttt{get\_value} accepts the same input and returns the second of the two numbers.
	\item Before proceeding, write unit tests to ensure that you have coded these functions correctly
	\item In \texttt{main}, do the following
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Start by running your unit tests. Print a message indicating that the tests passed.
		\item Open the file \filename{} (make sure to check if the file opens properly by using the \texttt{fail()} method)
		\item Open the output file, \texttt{measurements\_new.dat}. Also check for \texttt{fail()}
		\item Loop over the input file and use \texttt{getline} to read each line of the file into a string variable
		\item Use your functions to parse the string into two doubles, and write these doubles to the output file in the specified format
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Upload both your cpp file and your output file to Canvas
\end{enumerate}
